**evernote-append-to-notes.applescript**:

Append, to every note in a notebook, a list of tags, as hashtags and creation- and modification date. Useful if you want to move your notes to a system that currently does not support tags, such as Apple Notes.

WARNING: I strongly suggest you backup your notes before running this script. It might not do what you really want.
